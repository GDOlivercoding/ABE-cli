figure out effects (effect dicts)
figure out how to write functions (attacks etc) for all birds
maybe also adding the non bird allies

figure out the ratios (damage to other damage, red's attack to chili)
enemies' extra attacks
passives (birds and mostly enemies)
charging turns (3 turns to do x)
the default hp for anything?

25.11.24

effects figured out but still in progress
Effects class has methods which represent different events in the game
subclass this class, take turns and name arguments in the constructor
and attribute them to self

then override one of the methods for your functionality

the code is going great, some thing i want to do:
probably merge on_attack and on_hit since they are very similar
better access to self of Battlefield for other classes (Ally and Enemy)
write chuck's Mage & figure out multi attack

mainly think about the organisation here
because if every ability has to check for events thats quite annoying

also figure out when and who prints messages? the attack? Battlefield? what if i override it with an effect?

chuck's chili ability, like how -_-

!!!! SEPERATE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS !!!!

maybe do something about units in that topic too?
seperate? they are already seperated and i added an is_ally attribute
do i need to add more?

we make upgrades for classes?

cleanse & dispell

figure out allies with no classe (piggy mccool, prince porky and thing?)

make more effects because they are fun :damage

death checks where?

mostly, expand on the enemies, one singular attack aint finna gonna do it
maybe change how chili acts, right now, it is fine, it requires
20 hits on allies and or enemies to charge, in ab epic, its based on damage though

27.12.24

Implement a wave battle system for battle.Battlefield.start_battle()

a way to send flags to an attack ("bonus attack", "only 50% damage")

a way to first get the actual target, (ex.: targets with negative effects take more damage)
but when we send View.deal_damage() the target may change, and we have to way
to access that information

a better way to implement "Stuns", "Freezes" 
in the original game, the bird cant play its turn
so, id want to implement it that way, though not possible
right now, and quite irrelevant

30.12.

in the context of new_classes.py:

<- this is hard
make the Ability class get all info from VALUE_INDEX immediately
so it can be modified later on
OR let the user modify the Ability attrs before sending it though that does the same thing

maybe a better way to name the functions
when the name contain illegal characters?

and mostly continue to implement all the other classes overtime
in the near future, i am going to split away Enemies from battle.py
and add categories as subclasses n stuff::

    class Enemy(View): ...

    class Knight(Enemy):
    """
    knights' unique ability is that low damage deals only half the damage
    they have above medium health
    a strong attack, with sometimes something extra
    and usually one shielding-kinda support ability

    GuardKnight (???, the one in king pig's castle)
    CactusKnight
    RoyalKnight
    RoseKnight
    IceKnight
    MarineKnight
    """

    class RoyalKnight(Knight): ...

For devotion in effects.py and other combined effects
need to think of a way to merge the effects together
as it may collide

and again, the 50% damage flags :P am so silly :O

i (not accidentally) deleted classes.py, so now
rewrite everything suited for new_classes.py
just fix all type checker errors in battle.py :S

also gotta somehow fix iterating thru both effects dicts
if for some reason i want to go thru
both effect dicts, i usually merge them
but it can happen that there are two
effects with the same name which is obviously not good

resolve total hp for allies
^^^^^^^
current battle.py error

somehow put the CONTROLS from json
into Battlefield.start_battle()
because it dearly needs that ;-;
done
